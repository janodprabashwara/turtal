    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Sri Lanka, a beautiful island nation located in the Indian Ocean, is renowned for its rich biodiversity and diverse ecosystems.<br>
         One of the most fascinating aspects of Sri Lanka's wildlife is its turtle population. <br>
         The country's pristine beaches serve as nesting grounds for several species of sea turtles, making Sri Lanka a significant global hotspot for turtle conservation and research.</p>
<br>
<p>Sri Lanka is home to five species of sea turtles, all of which are endangered or critically endangered. These species include the Green turtle (Chelonia mydas), <br>Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta), Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), Olive Ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), and Leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea).<br> Each species has its unique characteristics, nesting behavior, and ecological significance.</p>
<br>
<p>Sri Lanka's turtle population also attracts tourists from around the world, offering unique opportunities to witness these magnificent creatures up close. <br>Responsible turtle tourism provides both economic benefits to local communities and educational experiences for visitors, promoting awareness and conservation efforts.</p>

    <ul class="numbered-list">
        <li>Restricting human interference: Strict regulations are implemented to limit human activities near nesting beaches and hatcheries to minimize disturbance to the turtles.</li> <br>
        <li> Nest relocation: In areas where nests are at risk of being washed away or damaged by natural elements or predators, hatchery staff may relocate the eggs to safer locations.</li> <br>
        <li> Protection from predators: Measures are taken to prevent predatory animals, such as dogs and monitor lizards, from accessing the nests or hatchlings.</li> <br>
        <li> Educating local communities: Awareness programs are conducted to educate local communities about the importance of turtle conservation and the need to protect the hatcheries.</li> <br>
        <li> Monitoring and research: Regular monitoring of nesting sites and hatcheries helps track the number of nests, hatching success rates, and the health of the turtles, enabling better conservation strategies.</li> <br>
        <li> Conservation laws and regulations: The Sri Lankan government has established laws and regulations to protect sea turtles and their nesting habitats, making it illegal to harm or disturb these endangered creatures.</li> <br>
