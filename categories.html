  <h1>Turtles of SriLanka</h1>
  <p>Turtles are fascinating reptiles that belong to the order Testudines. 
    There are various species of turtles found across the world, inhabiting diverse environments ranging from oceans and rivers to forests and deserts. Sri Lanka, an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, is home to several unique turtle species.These are some of the turtle species found in Sri Lanka. The country's coastal areas serve as important nesting grounds and habitats for these marine reptiles. <br><br>
    Conservation efforts, including turtle conservation projects, community involvement, and eco-tourism initiatives, play a significant role in protecting these species and their habitats in Sri Lanka.</p>

  <h2>Hawksbill Sea Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata)</h2>
  
  <p>Hawksbills are named for their narrow, pointed beak. They also have a distinctive pattern of overlapping scales on their shells that form a serrated-look on the edges. 
    These colored and patterned shells make them highly-valuable and commonly sold as "tortoiseshell" in markets.<br>
  Hawksbills are found mainly throughout the world's tropical oceans, predominantly in coral reefs. They feed mainly on sponges by using their narrow pointed beaks to extract them from crevices on the reef, but also eat sea anemones and jellyfish.
   Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years. They are a fundamental link in marine ecosystems and help maintain the health of coral reefs and sea grass beds.</p>

  <h2>Green Sea Turtle (Chelonia mydas)</h2>
  
  <p>The green turtle is one of the largest sea turtles and the only herbivore among the different species. Green turtles are in fact named for the greenish color of their cartilage and fat, not their shells. In the Eastern Pacific, a group of green turtles that have darker shells are called black turtles by the local community. Green turtles are found mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. Like other sea turtles, they migrate long distances between feeding grounds and the beaches from where they hatched. Classified as endangered, green turtles are threatened by overharvesting of their eggs, hunting of adults, being caught in fishing gear and loss of nesting beach sites.</p>

  <h2>Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta caretta)</h2>
  
  <p>Loggerhead turtles are named for their large heads that support powerful jaw muscles, allowing them to crush hard-shelled prey like clams and sea urchins. 
    They are less likely be hunted for their meat or shell compared to other sea turtles. Bycatch, the accidental capture of marine animals in fishing gear, is a serious problem for loggerhead turtles because they frequently come in contact with fisheries.<br>
  Loggerheads are the most common turtle in  Mediterranean, nesting on beaches from Greece and Turkey to Israel and Libya. Many of their nesting beaches are under threat from tourism development. Sea turtles are the living representatives of a group of reptiles that has existed on Earth and travelled our seas for the last 100 million years.

  <h2>Olive Ridley Sea Turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)</h2>
  <p>The name for this sea turtle is tied to the color of its shellâ€”an olive green hue. They are currently the most abundant of all sea turtles. Their vulnerable status comes from the fact that they nest in a very small number of places, and therefore any disturbance to even one nest beach could have huge repercussions on the entire population.</p>
